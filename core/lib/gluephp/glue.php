    /**
     * glue
     *
     * Provides an easy way to map URLs to classes. URLs can be literal
     * strings or regular expressions.
     *
     * When the URLs are processed:
     *      * delimiter (/) are automatically escaped: (\/)
     *      * The beginning and end are anchored (^ $)
     *      * An optional end slash is added (/?)
     *	    * The i option is added for case-insensitive searches
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * $urls = array(
     *     '/' => 'index',
     *     '/page/(\d+)' => 'page'
     * );
     *
     * class page {
     *      function GET($matches) {
     *          echo "Your requested page " . $matches[1];
     *      }
     * }
     *
     * glue::stick($urls);
